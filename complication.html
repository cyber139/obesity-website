<p>There are many complications that one will face when they get obese :</p>

<p><strong>Physical Complications</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Type 2 diabetes.</b> This chronic condition affects the way your child's body uses sugar (glucose). 
	Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.</li>
	<li><b>Metabolic syndrome.</b> This cluster of conditions can put your child at risk of heart disease, diabetes or other health problems.
 Conditions include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high triglycerides, low HDL ("good") cholesterol and excess abdominal fat.</li>
	<li><b>High cholesterol and high blood pressure.</b> A poor diet can cause your child to develop one or both of these conditions. 
	These factors can contribute to the buildup of plaques in the arteries, which can cause arteries to narrow and harden, possibly leading to a heart attack or stroke later in life.</li>
	<li><b>Asthma.</b> Children who are overweight or obese might be more likely to have asthma.</li>
	<li><b>Sleep disorders.</b> Obstructive sleep apnea is a potentially serious disorder in which a child's breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep.</li>
	<li><b>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).</b> This disorder, which usually causes no symptoms, causes fatty deposits to build up in the liver.
 	NAFLD can lead to scarring and liver damage.</li>
	<li><b>Bone fractures.</b> Obese children are more likely to break bones than are children of normal weight.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Social and Emotional Complications</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Low self-esteem and being bullied. </b>Children often tease or bully their overweight peers, who suffer a loss of self-esteem and an increased risk of depression as a result.</li>
	<li><b>Behavior and learning problems.</b> Overweight children tend to have more anxiety and poorer social skills than normal-weight children do. These problems might lead children who are overweight either to act out and disrupt their classrooms or to withdraw socially.</li>
	<li><b>Depression.</b> Low self-esteem can create overwhelming feelings of hopelessness, which can lead to depression in some children who are overweight.</li>

</ul>
