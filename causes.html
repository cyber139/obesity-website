<p>The balance between calorie intake and energy 
         expenditure determines a person's weight. If a person eats more calories than he or she burns
	 (metabolizes), the person gains weight (the body will store the excess energy as fat). 
	 If a person eats fewer calories than he or she metabolizes, he or she will lose weight.
	 Therefore, the most common causes of obesity are overeating and physical inactivity. Ultimately, 
	body weight is the result of genetics, metabolism, environment, behavior, and culture. <br />
<br />
         <b><u> Genetics.</u></b>  A person is more likely to develop obesity if one or both parents are obese.
         Genetics also affect hormones involved in fat regulation. For example, one genetic cause
         of obesity is leptin deficiency. Leptin is a hormone produced in fat cells and in the placenta.  
	 Leptin controls weight by signaling the brain to eat less when body fat stores are too high.
	 If, for some reason, the body cannot produce enough leptin or leptin cannot signal the brain 
	 to eat less, this control is lost, and obesity occurs. The role of leptin replacement as a 
	 treatment for obesity is under exploration. <br />
<br />
	 <b><u> Overeating.</u></b>  Overeating leads to weight gain, especially if the diet is high in fat. Foods high
	 in fat or sugar (for example, fast food, fried food, and sweets) have high energy density 
	 (foods that have a lot of calories in a small amount of food). Epidemiologic studies have 
	 shown that diets high in fat contribute to weight gain. <br />
<br />
	 <b><u> A diet high in simple carbohydrates.</u></b>  The role of carbohydrates in weight gain is not clear. 
	 Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, which in turn stimulate insulin release by the 
	 pancreas, and insulin promotes the growth of fat tissue and can cause weight gain. Some 
	 scientists believe that simple carbohydrates (sugars, fructose, desserts, soft drinks, beer, 
	 wine, etc.) contribute to weight gain because they are more rapidly absorbed into the 
	 bloodstream than complex carbohydrates (pasta, brown rice, grains, vegetables, raw fruits, etc.)
	 and thus cause a more pronounced insulin release after meals than complex carbohydrates. 
	 This higher insulin release, some scientists believe, contributes to weight gain. <br />
 <br />
	 <b><u> Frequency of eating.</u></b>  The relationship between frequency of eating (how often you eat) and weight 
	 is somewhat controversial. There are many reports of overweight people eating less often than 
	 people with normal weight. Scientists have observed that people who eat small meals four or
	 five times daily, have lower cholesterol levels and lower and/or more stable blood sugar levels
	 than people who eat less frequently (two or three large meals daily). One possible explanation
	 is that small frequent meals produce stable insulin levels, whereas large meals cause large spikes
	 of insulin after meals. <br />
<br />
	 <b><u> Physical inactivity.</u></b>  Sedentary people burn fewer calories than people who are active. The National
	 Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed a strong correlations between physical
	 inactivity and weight gain in both sexes. <br />
<br />
	 <b><u> Medications.</u></b>  Medications associated with weight gain include certain antidepressants (medications
	 used in treating depression), anticonvulsants (medications used in controlling seizures such
	 as carbamazepine [Tegretol, Tegretol XR , Equetro, Carbatrol] and valproate [Depacon, Depakene]),
	 some diabetes medications (medications used in lowering blood sugar such as insulin, sulfonylureas,
	 and thiazolidinediones), certain hormones such as oral contraceptives, and most corticosteroids
	 such as prednisone. Some high blood pressure medications and antihistamines cause weight gain.
	 The reason for the weight gain with the medications differs for each medication. If this is a
	 concern for you, you should discuss your medications with your physician rather than discontinuing	
	 the medication, as this could have serious effects. <br />
<br />
	 <b><u> Psychological factors.</u></b>  For some people, emotions influence eating habits. Many people eat excessively
	 in response to emotions such as boredom, sadness, stress, or anger. While most overweight people have
	 no more psychological disturbances than normal weight people, about 30% of the people who seek treatment
	 for serious weight problems have difficulties with binge eating. <br />
<br />
	 <b><u> Diseases</u></b>  such as hypothyroidism, insulin resistance, polycystic ovary syndrome, and Cushing's syndrome
	 are also contributors to obesity. Some diseases, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, can lead to obesity. <br />
<br />
	 <b><u> Social issues</u></b> : There is a link between social issues and obesity. Lack of money to purchase healthy
	 foods or lack of safe places to walk or exercise can increase the risk of obesity. <br />
