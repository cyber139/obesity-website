<p style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">Good eating habits and physical activity can help prevent obesity. Tips for adults to prevent obesity include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a food diary. Write down what you eat, where you eat, and how you feel before and after you eat.<br>
</li>
<li>Eat 5 to 9 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. A vegetable serving is 1 cup of raw vegetables or 1/2 cup of cooked vegetables or vegetable juice. A fruit serving is 1 piece of small to medium fresh fruit, 1/2 cup of canned or fresh fruit or fruit juice, or 1/4 cup of dried fruit.</li>
<li>Choose whole-grain foods. These include brown rice and whole-wheat bread. Don't eat foods made with refined white sugar, flour, high-fructose corn syrup, or saturated fat.</li>
<li>Weigh and measure food. This is so you can learn healthy portion sizes. For example, a 3-ounce serving of meat is the size of a deck of cards. Don't order supersized menu items.</li>
<li>Learn to read food nutrition labels and use them. Keep the number of portions you are really eating in mind.</li>
<li>Balance your food "checkbook." If you eat more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. Weigh yourself each week.</li>
<li>Don't eat foods that are high in "energy density." This means foods that have a lot of calories in small amounts. For example, a cheeseburger with fries can have as much as 1,000 calories and 30 or more grams of fat. Order a grilled chicken sandwich or a plain hamburger and a small salad with low-fat dressing instead. You can avoid hundreds of calories and lower your fat intake. For dessert, have a serving of fruit, yogurt, a small piece of angel food cake, or a piece of dark chocolate.</li>
<li>Reduce portion sizes. Using a smaller plate can help you do this.</li>
<li>Aim for 60 to 90 minutes or more of moderate to intense physical activity 3 to 4 days each week. Examples of moderate intensity exercise are walking a 15-minute mile, or weeding and hoeing a garden. Running or playing singles tennis are examples of more intense activities.</li>
<li>Look for ways to get 10 or 15 minutes of some type of activity during the day. Walk around the block. Walk up and down a few flights of stairs.</li>
<p>   </p>
<p>There's a lot of thing that one can do to prevent from getting obese so, walk a little more, eat a little less ï¿½ and do what you need to do to maintain a healthy BMI.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center; background-color: #b3cde0;">Can we cure obesity?</h1>

<p> Apparently, scientifically speaking, there is no such thing as CURING obesity. Obesity is the type of illness that could cause other illness such as heart problems and many other things. Obesity can happen to a point that a person  can no longer go back to a healthy life style. </p>


<p>Therefore, it is important for us who have a risk of beung obese to take careful steps and do all the activities above to prevent obesity from happening.  Take a good prevention step to stay healthy. Better sooner than later, better late than never."</p>
