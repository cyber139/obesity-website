<p>Malaysia is <b>Asia�s fattest country</b> with approximately half of the population overweight or obese. According to Cambridge Dictionary, obesity is the fact of <b>being extremely fat, in a way that is dangerous for health.</b> Obesity is <b>a medical condition that occurs when a person carries excess weight or body fat that might affect their health.</b> A doctor will usually suggest that a person has obesity if they have a high body mass index. (Brazier, 2018)
</p>

<p><br>
  <b>Body mass index (BMI)</b> is a tool that doctors use to assess if a person is at an appropriate weight for their age, sex, and height. The measurement combines height and weight. A BMI between 25 and 29.9 indicates that a person is carrying excess weight. A BMI of 30 or over suggests that a person may have obesity. (Brazier, 2018)

<p>Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults (18 years and above) were <b>30.0%</b> and <b>17.7%</b> respectively in 2015 (National Health & Morbidity Survey [NHMS] 2015) compared to <b>16.6%</b> and <b>4.4%</b> respectively in 1996 (NHMS 1996). The prevalence of overweight and obesity had increased <b>80.7%</b> and <b>30.2%</b> respectively in just under two decades. The prevalence in children below 18 years was not encouraging, with <b>11.9%</b> obese (NHMS 2015). (Lum, 2018).
</p>

<p>If a person does have obesity and excess weight, this can <b>increase their risk of developing a number of health conditions,</b> including metabolic syndrome, arthritis, and some types of cancer. (Brazier, 2018)
</p>

<p>Metabolic syndrome involves a collection of issues, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. <b>Maintaining a healthy weight or losing through diet and exercise</b> is one way to prevent or reduce obesity. In some cases, a person may need <b>surgery.</b> (Brazier, 2018)
